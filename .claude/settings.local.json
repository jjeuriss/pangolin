Database writes causing excessive reads \\(SQLite WAL/journal\\)?\n2. Another query path we haven''t identified yet?\n3. Database cleanup operations?\n\nThis test disables ALL request audit logging to verify if writes are the culprit.\n\nIf disk I/O drops significantly with this change, we know the issue is with\nthe audit log writes themselves \\(or triggered by them\\), not the filter queries.\n\nNext steps after testing:\n- If I/O drops: Investigate SQLite write behavior, WAL mode, journal size\n- If I/O persists: Look for other query sources \\(analytics, cleanup jobs, etc.\\)\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]\\(https://claude.com/claude-code\\)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n\\)\")",
